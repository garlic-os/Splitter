# Splitter
Project progress: https://github.com/users/garlic-os/projects/4/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc&layout=board

## Setup
Install your dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then register the bot's slash commands:
```bash
npm run register-commands
```
You only need to register the slash commands once per bot account.

## Development server
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
