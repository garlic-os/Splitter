# Splitter
[Project progress](https://github.com/users/garlic-os/projects/4/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc&layout=board)

## Setup
Install your dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), then register the bot's slash commands:
```bash
npm run register-commands
```
You only need to register the slash commands once per bot account.

## Development
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
When in dev mode, a quirk in Vite makes it so you have to open the webapp once for the bot to start.

## Production
```bash
npm run host
```
