# Splitter Privacy Policy
This Privacy Statement explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your data, including any personal data we collect and process in
connection with our Discord bot and any applications, software, products, and
services provided by Splitter, (collectively, the "Service(s)").

**Your files are not encrypted.** Splitter just uploads them to a channel out
there on Discord, and the process of "downloading" a file is fetching those
attachments and putting them back together.
